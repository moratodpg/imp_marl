# Experiments data from Zenodo

The experiments data are in the three zip files:
1. `best_agent_networks.zip`: The controller networksâ€™ weights of the best MARL-based policies.  
2. `heur_logs.zip`: The configuration, execution, and result files of the computed expert-based heuristic policies.
3. `MARL logs.zip`: The configuration, execution, and result files of all investigated MARL methods.

## Download instruction

To retrieve the logs, you need to download the data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8032339).

We created a script to automate the download and unzip process: [download_logs.sh](download_logs.sh).

## Plot scripts

You will be able to create all figures from the paper with the different notebooks.
Beware that the first cell may be updated to find the logs if you chose something other than `results_scripts/logs`.

The names of the notebooks are self-explanatory:

- [box_plots](box_plots.ipynb): create the Figure 2 of the paper with the relative boxplots.
- [find_best_networks](find_best_networks.ipynb): find the best network for each run.
- [generate_table](generate_table.ipynb): generate the tables of the best results of the paper.
- [plot_learning_curves](plot_learning_curves.ipynb): create the figure X and Y of the paper with the learning curves.
- [plot_testing_time](plot_testing_time.ipynb): create the figures X and Y of the paper with the testing time.
- [plot_training_time](plot_training_time.ipynb): create the figures X and Y of the paper with the training time.
- [plot_variance](plot_variance.ipynb): create the figure X of the paper with the variance of the results.
